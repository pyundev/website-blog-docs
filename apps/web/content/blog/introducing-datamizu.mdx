## Introducing Datamizu

Today, we're thrilled to announce Datamizu, a serverless platform designed to simplify how teams collect, process, and visualize data. Our platform combines the power of ETL pipelines, interactive notebooks, and data apps in one seamless workspace.

## Why We Built Datamizu

In today's data-driven world, teams face three major challenges:
- Managing complex infrastructure for data processing
- Creating accessible insights for non-technical stakeholders
- Controlling unpredictable costs as data grows

Datamizu solves these challenges by offering a fully serverless platform where you can focus on your data, not your infrastructure.

## Key Features That Make Datamizu Different

Write pipelines in the language you know best:
- Python for data scientists
- SQL for analysts
- R for statistical analysis

### Modern Notebook Experience
Our notebooks go beyond traditional Jupyter:
- Real-time collaboration for teams
- Built-in version control
- AI-powered code assistance
- Rich text editing capabilities

### Data Apps for Everyone
Transform your analyses into interactive dashboards and apps that executives and stakeholders can easily understand and use.
